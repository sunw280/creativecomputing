      There are variety of elements in web design. And from the details including the style of the front, the layout of the website, the colors of the pages and the main content of the pages, web design reflects the culture that represents the content. A good web design usually are designed to associate with the topic, usage or ideas of the website. So the viewer can expect the content of the page they are looking at. For example, if we go on the fashion related website, the layout is usually designed very neat and simple to demonstrate the sense of fashion.

      Web design is a very important and effective tool to express our culture, through the details of design including the pattern of the background and the choice of the front, it allows viewers to explore a new content of culture.
